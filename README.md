## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Similar to sheep problem.

In here , save location of all land and searching from land.

If that land had already visited, do nothing.

If that land had not been visited, search every direction. 

If there is no way to visit, end searching and start searching from another land location.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
